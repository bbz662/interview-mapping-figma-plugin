    # User Research Analysis Instructions Using KA Method

    ## Overview
    This is a guideline for analyzing user interview transcripts using the KA method to gain deep insights based on the research objectives. The final output will be in JSON format, compatible with Figma plugins.

    ## Prerequisites
    - Interview transcript content
    - Research objectives

    ## Procedure

    ### 1. Understanding and Preparing Interview Content
    1.1 Carefully read through the provided interview transcript.
    1.2 Confirm the research objectives and define the focus of the analysis.
    1.3 Remember the main topics and recurring themes to deepen overall understanding of the interview content without outputting them.

    ### 2. Creating KA Cards
    2.1 Identify important "events" from the interview content. Pay attention to the following points:
      - Select events that demonstrate specific user behaviors or experiences
      - Focus on areas where emotional responses or values are expressed
      - Prioritize events related to the research objectives

    2.2 Create KA cards in the following JSON format:
    {
      "KACards": [
        {
          "id": "KA01",
          "event": "Specific event or action",
          "innerVoice": "User's internal response or emotion regarding that event",
          "value": "Essential value derived from that event"
        },
        {
          "id": "KA02",
          "event": "...",
          "innerVoice": "...",
          "value": "..."
        }
      ]
    }

    2.3 Points to note when creating KA cards:

    Describe "events" as specific and observable actions or situations
    Reproduce the user's words as faithfully as possible in the "inner voice," reflecting emotions and thoughts
    Express "value" at an appropriate level of abstraction, neither too abstract nor too specific
    If multiple values can be derived from one event, create separate KA cards

    2.4 Create at least 20 or more KA cards and assign unique IDs (KA01, KA02, ...) to each card.
    2.5 Review the created KA cards and confirm the following points:

    Does the content align with the research objectives?
    Are the user's potential needs and values reflected?
    Does it capture deeper meanings beyond surface-level statements?

    3. Value-based Clustering
    3.1 Group the created KA cards by similar values. Pay attention to the following points:

    Consider logical relationships as well as intuitive judgments
    Start with small groups and gradually combine them into larger groups
    Consider the possibility that one KA card may belong to multiple groups

    3.2 Output clusters in the following JSON format:
    {
      "clusters": [
        {
          "id": "A",
          "name": "Cluster name (specific and contextual)",
          "representingValue": "Explanation of the value representing the cluster",
          "kaCards": ["KA01", "KA03", "KA05"]
        },
        {
          "id": "B",
          "name": "...",
          "representingValue": "...",
          "kaCards": ["..."]
        }
      ]
    }

    3.3 How to name clusters:

    Avoid general and abstract names (e.g., "convenience," "efficiency") and use specific, contextual names
    Consider names that reflect users' words and emotions
    If possible, include verbs or actions in the name
    Ensure that the essence of the values included in the group can be understood from the group name

    3.4 Record any new insights or realizations that occur during the clustering process.
    3.5 Review the KA cards within each cluster and consider whether the cluster name is appropriate. Make adjustments as necessary.
    4. Relationship Analysis
    4.1 Analyze the relationships between clusters and output in the following JSON format:
    {
      "relationships": [
        {
          "from": "A",
          "to": "B",
          "type": "strong",
          "description": "Brief explanation of the relationship",
          "relatedKACards": ["KA01", "KA07"]
        },
        {
          "from": "B",
          "to": "C",
          "type": "weak",
          "description": "...",
          "relatedKACards": ["..."]
        }
      ]
    }

    4.2 Points to note in relationship analysis:

    Identify value clusters with strong relationships and explain the reasons specifically
    Pay attention to contradictory or unexpected relationships
    Reference specific KA card content in relationship explanations
    Consider complex interrelationships, not just simple binary oppositions

    ## Overall Precautions

    Always center the analysis on the user's perspective.
    Be aware of preconceptions and personal biases, and strive for objective, data-based analysis.
    If questions or uncertainties arise during the analysis process, ask questions and seek confirmation as appropriate.
    Take sufficient care in handling personal information and anonymize as necessary.
    Be aware that these analysis results will be shared with the entire product development team and lead to concrete actions.
    Confirm that all JSON data is correctly structured and in a format that can be processed by Figma plugins.
